Look for budget-friendly options like fast food, buffets (check for deals), or grocery stores.\n*   **Gambling:** If you gamble, set a strict budget and stick to it. Don't chase losses.\n*   **Drinks:** Alcohol can be expensive. Consider buying drinks at a grocery store to enjoy in your room before going out.\n*   **Shows:** Look for free shows (like the Bellagio Fountains or Mirage Volcano) or discounted tickets.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   **Prices are estimates** and can vary depending on the time of year, day of the week, and availability. Always check current pricing before booking.\n*   **Ratings are subjective** and based on general user reviews.\n*   **Travel times are estimates** and can be affected by traffic.\n*   **Confirm show schedules** and hours of operation before you go.\n*   **Weather:** Las Vegas can be extremely hot in the summer.  Plan accordingly.\n*   **Safety:** Be aware of your surroundings and take precautions against theft.\n\nEnjoy your trip to Las Vegas!\n"},
